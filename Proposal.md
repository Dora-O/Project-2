## Title

Premiere

## Description

Premiere is an application that allows a user to create a screening discussion board to share their personal projects with friends. He/She/They could invite their friends to sign up into the screening room to experience their work (as a shared link) and be able to comment into a discussion board. I am also able to notify my friends about upcoming screenings with a email notification. The app will focus on displaying media via linkshare, but could in the future be implemented with Livestreams, Featured Films, Short Films, Commercials and much more.
